# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
Hand gestures provide a natural way for humans to interact with computers to perform a variety of different applications. However, factors such as the complexity of hand gesture structures, differences in hand size, hand posture, and environmental illumination can influence the performance of hand gesture recognition algorithms. Recent advances in Deep Learning have significantly advanced the performance of image recognition systems. In particular, the Deep Convolutional Neural Network has demonstrated superior performance in image representation and classification, compared to conventional machine learning approaches.

Trained a deep neural network model to classify different hand gestures with [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog)
using AlexNet State of the Art Model.
The model on training achieved an accuracy of 95%.
